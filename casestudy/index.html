        <h2 class="casetitle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project explores the end-to-end redesign of microinteractions for the Drexel DIGM degree cards 
            found on the program’s homepage. The original interface contained minimal hover feedback and few 
            interactive affordances that could enhance users’ sense of control and engagement. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Across three development stages of Alpha, Beta, and Final Builds, I designed, documented, and coded 
            progressively more complex microinteractions. Each build was implemented in its own webpage, 
            allowing me to evolve the interaction behaviors. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The final solution introduces a fully interactive card system featuring hover animation, 
            color transitions, menu expansion, a favorite button, sharing animations, and a 3D flip card interaction. 
            These improvements create a richer and more interactive experience ali.

        <h2 class="casetitle">Context and Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            For this Project, I had to examine the degree-cards area on <a href="https://digm.drexel.edu/" target="_blank"> Drexel's DIGM website</a>
            and iterate a set of microinteractions. The project required designing and coding three levels of the microinteractions, each documented separately and built in standalone webpages.
            These were Alpha and Alpha Build, Beta and Beta Build, and Final and Final Build. The purpose was to improve the existing interface by enhancing 
            meaningful interactions that reinforce user control, readability, and delight.
