    <h1 id="title">Microinteraction Redesign for DIGM Degree Cards</h1>

        <h2 class="casetitle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project explores the end-to-end redesign of microinteractions for the Drexel DIGM degree cards 
            found on the program’s homepage. The original interface contained minimal hover feedback and few 
            interactive affordances that could enhance users’ sense of control and engagement. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Across three development stages of Alpha, Beta, and Final Builds, I designed, documented, and coded 
            progressively more complex microinteractions. Each build was implemented in its own webpage, 
            allowing me to evolve the interaction behaviors. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The final solution introduces a fully interactive card system featuring hover animation, 
            color transitions, menu expansion, a favorite button, sharing animations, and a 3D flip card interaction. 
            These improvements create a richer and more interactive experience ali.

        <h2 class="casetitle">Context and Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            For this Project, I had to examine the degree-cards area on <a href="https://digm.drexel.edu/" target="_blank"> Drexel's DIGM website</a>
            and iterate a set of microinteractions. The project required designing and coding three levels of the microinteractions, each documented separately and built in standalone webpages.
            These were Alpha and Alpha Build, Beta and Beta Build, and Final and Final Build. The purpose was to improve the existing interface by enhancing 
            meaningful interactions that reinforce user control, readability, and delight.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The existing page worked, but the interactions felt flat and unresponsive. There were no visual cues to guide users or acknowledge their actions, which made the experience feel less engaging.
                I saw this as an opportunity to add microinteractions, small moments of feedback that help users feel more connected and engaged as they navigate the page.

        <div class="casetext">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To understand where microinteractions could make the biggest impact, I reviewed the existing page 
                and observed how users would interacted with its main features. I paid attention to moments where there might 
                be hesitations or repeated actions. These small points of friction highlighted where feedback was missing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also looked at common patterns from similar interfaces to see how they used motion, hover states, and visual 
                cues to guide users. This helped me identify opportunities to create a more responsive experience. Overall, 
                the research confirmed that adding purposeful microinteractions would help the page 
                feel smoother and more engaging.

            <p>The goal was to introduce one simple microinteraction based only on Hover state. I also added the descriptions including the 
                trigger, rules, feedback, loop, and mode. Below is the hover mirointeraction that the existing page have.

                This is where i built and coded the Hover microinteraction that was described in Alpha usng HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            
            <p>Key interactions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Hover makes image go from grayscale → color</p></li>
                <li><p>Image zooms slightly</p></li>
                <li><p>Card background becomes gradient</p></li>
                <li><p>Hover off reverses all animations</p></li>

                In the Beta stage, I took what worked from the Alpha version and added 2 more microinteractions. 
                The interactions i added was a "+" or "more" button which triggers with a click and a "Favorite" button with triggers with a click.
                I tested different timings, easing styles, and feedback patterns to see which options supported the user experience best.

                In the Beta Build, I coded a different HTML based webpage and added JavaScript since i had some microinteractions that triggers by clicking. 
            </p>
            <h4>Descriptions on additional microinteractions:</h4>

                In the final stage, I designed 3 complex microinteraction designs to the 3 that already existed in Alpha and Beta. 
                These were; one hover trigger and two click-triggered actions. Each interaction was carefully 
                prototyped in Figma to test timing, motion, and usability before being finalized and coded.

                All 6 microinteractions were coded on a separate HTML based webpage with all 6 microinteractions functional.
            </p>
            <h4>Descriptions on total microinteractions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Hover (degree card) — grayscale → color, subtle zoom (1.04), background gradient, pointer cursor.</p></li>
                <li><p>"+" Menu (click) — plus icon rotates 135° into an X; a menu panel slides open from the right.</p></li>
                <li><p>Favorite button (click) — icon toggles fill state (instant visual change; spec includes DB persistence).</p></li>
                <li><p>Share button (click) — brief “fly out” send motion for the icon to convey action.</p></li>
                <li><p>Flip (Hover) — Hover fills flip icon left to right</p></li>
                <li><p>Flip (click) — card flips horizontally to show the back; click executes flip animation.</p></li>

        <h2 class="casetitle">The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Through iterative builds and prototyping, the final solution delivered an interactive and a more confident user experience. 
            The microinteractions worked together to create a page that communicates clearly, responds naturally, and feels more enjoyable to navigate.

            Final Build Microinteractions.</a></button>

            The final outcome was a more engaging page that responded naturally to user actions. 
            The added microinteractions helped guide users, reduce hesitation, and make the interface feel more alive. 
            The different stages of design in both Figma and coded prototypes showed clear improvements in clarity and overall interactivity. 
            The project demonstrated how small, thoughtful details can significantly improve the experience without changing the core layout or structure.

            <h3>What i learned:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>How progressive iteration strengthens design quality</p></li>
                <li><p>How microinteractions reinforce meaning and usability</p></li>
                <li><p>The importance of documenting every interaction clearly</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            If I were to approach this project again, I would spend time gathering user feedback between each build, rather than relying mainly on my own observations. 
            I would also explore more variations during the stages to broaden the range of possibilities before narrowing down. These changes would help create an 
            even stronger and more user-informed final experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, the project reinforced how microinteractions, when designed with purpose, can elevate an interface in a meaningful and memorable way.
