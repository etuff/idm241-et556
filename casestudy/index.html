        <h2 class="casetitle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project explores the end-to-end redesign of microinteractions for the Drexel DIGM degree cards 
            found on the program’s homepage. The original interface contained minimal hover feedback and few 
            interactive affordances that could enhance users’ sense of control and engagement. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Across three development stages of Alpha, Beta, and Final Builds, I designed, documented, and coded 
            progressively more complex microinteractions. Each build was implemented in its own webpage, 
            allowing me to evolve the interaction behaviors. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The final solution introduces a fully interactive card system featuring hover animation, 
            color transitions, menu expansion, a favorite button, sharing animations, and a 3D flip card interaction. 
            These improvements create a richer and more interactive experience ali.

        <h2 class="casetitle">Context and Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            For this Project, I had to examine the degree-cards area on <a href="https://digm.drexel.edu/" target="_blank"> Drexel's DIGM website</a>
            and iterate a set of microinteractions. The project required designing and coding three levels of the microinteractions, each documented separately and built in standalone webpages.
            These were Alpha and Alpha Build, Beta and Beta Build, and Final and Final Build. The purpose was to improve the existing interface by enhancing 
            meaningful interactions that reinforce user control, readability, and delight.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The existing page worked, but the interactions felt flat and unresponsive. There were no visual cues to guide users or acknowledge their actions, which made the experience feel less engaging.
                I saw this as an opportunity to add microinteractions, small moments of feedback that help users feel more connected and engaged as they navigate the page.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To understand where microinteractions could make the biggest impact, I reviewed the existing page 
                and observed how users would interacted with its main features. I paid attention to moments where there might 
                be hesitations or repeated actions. These small points of friction highlighted where feedback was missing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also looked at common patterns from similar interfaces to see how they used motion, hover states, and visual 
                cues to guide users. This helped me identify opportunities to create a more responsive experience. Overall, 
                the research confirmed that adding purposeful microinteractions would help the page 
                feel smoother and more engaging.
